      <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a
        web browser.
        It defines the content and structure of web content.
        It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
        JavaScript.
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages.
        HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
      </p>
      <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
        With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
        HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,
        paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags are directly used to introduce the
        content of pages.
        Other tags are used to surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags.
        Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
        HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
        content of web pages.
        The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.
        The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards.
        It has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is
        used to display video and audio, together with JavaScript.</p>

        The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the
        Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.
        It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML.
        Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized
        Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN.
        Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.

        In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
        researchers to use and share documents.
        In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.
        Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.
        That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for
        funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN.
        In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an
        encyclopedia is the first entry.

        <h1>Data Types</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
        HTML defines several data types for element content, such as script data and stylesheet data, and a plethora of
        types for attribute values, including IDs, names, URIs, numbers, units of length, languages, media descriptors,
        colors, character encodings, dates and times, and so on.
        All of these data types are specializations of character data.

      <p>
        HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements.
        These are indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets.
        In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u> Elements Example:</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>
              <pre>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        &lt;html&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;
          &lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;body&gt;
           &lt;p&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/body&gt;
          &lt;/hlml&gt;
              </pre>
            </code>
      </p>
      <p>The text between<code> &lt;html&gt;</code>and<code> &lt;/html&gt;</code>
        describes the web page, and the text between &lt;body&gt;and &lt;/body&gt;
        is the visible page content. The markup text <code> &lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;</code>
        defines the browser page title shown on browser tabs and window titles.
        The Document Type Declaration &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is for HTML5.
        If a declaration is not included, various browsers will revert to "quirks mode" for rendering.
      </p>
      <p>Other examples include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>: <br> It used to embed images,
          the reference to the image resource in the format like this: <code>&lt;img src="example.jpg"&gt;</code>
        </li>

        <li><code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>: <br> Some elements, such as the line break
          do not permit any embedded content, either text or further tags.
          These require only a single empty tag and do not use an end tag.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>: <br> HTML headings are defined with the
          <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> tags with H1 being the highest (or most important) level
          and H6 the least
        </li>
        <li> &lt; a &gt;: <br>
          To create a link the &lt; a &gt; tag is used. The href attribute holds the URL address of the link.
          format is like this: <code>&lt; a href="https://example.org/" &gt;</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>&lt; input type=""&gt;</code>: <br>
          There are many possible ways a user can give input/s like: <code>&lt; input type="text"&gt;</code>
        </li>

    <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
      <header>
        <h1>Attributes</h1>
      </header>
      Most of the attributes of an element are name-value pairs,
      separated by = and written within the start tag of an element after the element's name.
      There are several common attributes that may appear in many elements:
      <ul>
        <p>
          <li>The
            <code>id</code> attribute provides a document-wide unique identifier for an element.
            This is used to identify the element so that stylesheets can alter its presentational properties, and
            scripts may alter, animate or delete its contents or presentation
          </li>
          <li>
            The <code>class</code> attribute provides a way of classifying similar elements.
            This can be used for semantic or presentation purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <code>style</code> attribute is used to assign presentational properties to a particular element.
            It is considered better practice to use an element's id or class attributes to select the element from
            within a stylesheet.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <code>title</code> attribute is used to attach a subtextual explanation to an element.
            In most browsers this attribute is displayed as a tooltip.
          </li>
          <li>
            The lang attribute identifies the natural language of the element's contents, which may be different from
            that of the rest of the document.
          </li>
        </p>
      </ul>

      HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.
      It provides the framework that browsers interpret to display web pages.
      <h3>key component in html</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>
          <li>
            Elements: HTML is made up of elements, each defined by tags.
            Tags are usually paired (e.g., &lt; p &gt; ... &lt; /p &gt;) to wrap content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tags: Tags are used to create elements.
            They usually include opening &lt; tagname &gt; and closing &lt; /tagname &gt;
            tags (like &lt; h1 &gt; for headers, &lt; p &gt; for paragraphs).
          </li>
          <li>
            Attributes: Tags can have attributes that provide additional information, such as <code>class</code>,
            <code>id</code>, <code>href</code>, <code>src</code>, etc.
            Example:<code> &lt; a href="https://example.com" &gt; Link &lt; /a &gt;</code>
